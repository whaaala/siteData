üìã TASK: Create a compelling headline that is COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from the original in structure, angle, and wording.

üéØ SEO OPTIMIZATION:
- Length: 60-70 characters (ideal for search results and social media)
- Include 1-2 primary keywords from the original
- Use power words that drive clicks: "Reveals," "Breaks Silence," "Sparks Debate," "Inside," "Exclusive," "Shocking Truth," "What You Need to Know"
- Front-load the most important keyword
- Use numbers when relevant (e.g., "5 Things," "Top 10")

üî• ENGAGEMENT TACTICS:
- Start with an emotional hook (curiosity, surprise, urgency, controversy)
- Use active voice and present tense
- Create intrigue without being clickbait

‚úÖ ADSENSE COMPLIANCE:

- Keep it factual, neutral, and accurate

üåç NIGERIAN/AFRICAN FOCUS:
- Highlight Nigerian/African angle first
- Use culturally relevant language and expressions
- Consider local impact and relevance

                - Include relevant data, statistics, or comparisons to make the article more informative for local readers.

                üö¶ Balance & Counterpoints

                - Consider whether penalties or solutions are sufficient, and present counterpoints or alternative views.

                üö¶ SEO & User Engagement Enhancements
                - Use SEO-friendly subheadings, short paragraphs, and bullet lists for clarity.
                - Where possible, add internal links to related content (e.g., similar news, backgrounders, or explainers).
                - Use visuals, charts, or maps if possible (as HTML or placeholders), and ensure images are credited or licensed.

                  Story sales/submissions: <a href="mailto:story@nowahalazone.com"><strong>story@nowahalazone.com</strong></a>
                - If the content is about food, invite readers to share their own recipes or food stories, and MUST include the food contact email:
                  Food inquiries: <a href="mailto:food@nowahalazone.com"><strong>food@nowahalazone.com</strong></a>
                - For news, business, or sensitive topics, encourage readers to share tips, opinions, or stories, and mention the general support or story submission email.
                - For entertainment, sports, or lifestyle, invite readers to comment, share their experiences, or follow on social media.
                - Always include the appropriate contact email(s) and social media links, but introduce them in a way that fits the content context and feels natural and engaging.
                - All social media links MUST include target="_blank" so they open in a new tab.
                - Make the footer conversational and locally relevant.

                  Example (for general article):
                  "Have a story you want to share or sell? We'd love to hear from you! Email us at <a href='mailto:story@nowahalazone.com'><strong>story@nowahalazone.com</strong></a> to get your story featured or discuss story sales.
