            - Make it as short and punchy as possible for SEO/discovery, while keeping it catchy, clear, and contextually accurate.

            IMPORTANT: 
            - Do NOT remove, move, or alter any placeholders like [[EMBED_0]], [[EMBED_1]], etc. Leave all placeholders exactly where they appear in the input.
            - Preserve all original HTML tags and structure, including <p>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <a>, <blockquote>, <iframe>, <div>, <img>, <video>, and any other tags present in the source. Do NOT remove, move, or alter the position of any embedded social media, video, or image HTML code.

            üö¶ Core Rules (Apply to All Content)
            - Minimum 900 words, original structure and narrative, AdSense-safe, and factually accurate.
            - Attribute all facts, quotes, and claims to credible sources. If unverified, state as ‚Äúalleged,‚Äù ‚Äúreportedly,‚Äù or ‚Äúaccording to sources.‚Äù
            - Avoid sensationalism, clickbait, or emotionally charged language unless directly quoted and attributed.
            - Use neutral, respectful tone, especially for sensitive topics. Avoid graphic detail about death, suffering, or betrayal.
            - Always include local context and relevance for Nigerian/West African readers.
            - For global news, relate the story to how it could affect local readers, markets, or daily life.
            - End with a locally relevant question or call to action.
            - At the end, include contact info in this format (each on its own line or paragraph):
              Food inquiries: <a href="mailto:food@nowahalazone.com"><strong>food@nowahalazone.com</strong></a>
              General support: <a href="mailto:support@nowahalazone.com"><strong>support@nowahalazone.com</strong></a>
              Story sales/submissions: <a href="mailto:story@nowahalazone.com"><strong>story@nowahalazone.com</strong></a>
              (Never use source emails.)
            - Then add:
              Follow us on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wahaala.wahaala"><strong>Facebook</strong></a><br>
              Follow us on <a href="https://x.com/wahaala2"><strong>X (Twitter)</strong></a><br>
              Follow us on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wahaalawahala"><strong>Instagram</strong></a>

            üö¶ AdSense Safety & Robustness (Mandatory for All Content)
            - Use precise, cautious, and neutral language for all claims and reactions. Use words like ‚Äúalleges,‚Äù ‚Äúclaims,‚Äù ‚Äúsays,‚Äù ‚Äúaccording to [source],‚Äù rather than stating as fact.
            - Attribute all claims, quotes, and strong statements to specific, credible sources (e.g., ‚Äúaccording to Fayose on [platform],‚Äù ‚Äúas reported by [news outlet],‚Äù ‚Äúdata from [source]‚Äù). If data is not public, clearly state this.
            - Always include responses or counterpoints from those who disagree, rebut, or provide alternative perspectives (e.g., critics, community leaders, legal/political analysts, affected groups).
            - Provide context: include historical data, relevant facts, or constitutional provisions to help readers understand the background and significance of the claim.
            - Avoid broad, absolute statements‚Äîuse estimates, ranges, or qualifiers (e.g., ‚Äúreportedly,‚Äù ‚Äúis believed to,‚Äù ‚Äúsources suggest‚Äù) unless facts are independently verified.
            - Tone down headlines and body text to clarify when something is a claim or opinion, not an established fact (e.g., ‚Äúclaims,‚Äù ‚Äúreportedly,‚Äù ‚Äúis said to be‚Äù).
            - Avoid sensationalist, provocative, or misleading language. Do not present unverified or comparative assertions as fact.
            - Avoid shaming, stereotyping, or insulting language toward any group or individual. Never suggest ethnic superiority or exclusion. Focus on commentary and analysis, not judgment.
            - Maintain a neutral, balanced tone and avoid bias toward one viewpoint. Encourage respectful discourse.
            - Add cultural, ethical, or social reflections where relevant‚Äîexplain why the issue is sensitive, and encourage thoughtful, constructive discussion.
            - End with a reflective, constructive engagement question that invites readers to share their views (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat do you think about ethnic representation in Nigerian leadership‚Äîhas it been fair? Share your view.‚Äù).
            - Ensure all disclaimers and attributions are clear, especially for controversial or comparative claims.

            üö¶ Readability, Structure, Visuals & SEO (Mandatory for All Content)
            - Avoid repetition: Vary attributions and synonyms for sources (e.g., alternate ‚Äúaccording to,‚Äù ‚Äúhe emphasized,‚Äù ‚Äúofficials noted,‚Äù ‚Äústakeholders said,‚Äù etc.).
            - Organize the article for smooth flow: Start with the main directive or news, then stakeholder reactions, passenger rights, infrastructure issues, global comparisons, and forward outlook.
            - Make all subheadings SEO-rich and engaging, using relevant keywords and clear, punchy language. Subheadings must naturally include target keywords from the article‚Äôs main topic for better scannability and SEO.
            - Break up long paragraphs for easier online reading.
            - Use bullet points or numbered lists for key regulatory changes, meeting highlights, or major complaints/issues where appropriate.
            - Where possible, find and insert actual free-to-use (copyright-safe, Creative Commons, or public domain) images from the web that fit the subject matter. Only use images that are allowed for reuse (e.g., Unsplash, Wikimedia Commons, Pexels, etc.), and insert the actual <img> HTML tag with the correct src and credit in the rewritten content. Do not suggest images‚Äîonly include them if they are truly free to use and allowed for this purpose. If no suitable image is available, do not add any image or suggestion. Never move, remove, or alter any placeholders like [[EMBED_0]]‚Äîleave them exactly where they appear in the input, and make sure none of the images you add (if any) are in conflict with any placeholders.
            - Ensure the content is easy to scan, with clear sections, logical progression, and visual breaks where possible.
