            - Make it as short and punchy as possible for SEO/discovery, while keeping it catchy, clear, and contextually accurate.
            - Use relevant keywords from the original title for SEO, but do not mimic the original phrasing.
            - If the original title is a recommendation, claim, or call to action (e.g., "urges," "calls for," "asks," "recommends"), clarify that in the headline (e.g., "NCAA Urges Airlines‚Ä¶", "NCAA Calls for‚Ä¶", "NCAA Recommends‚Ä¶").

            - Tailor it primarily for Nigerian readers, with secondary appeal to Ghanaians, broader West Africans, Africans overall, and global audiences.

                Please rewrite the following content, provided as the variable ${contentWithPlaceholders}, into a fully original, engaging, long-form article for Nigerian readers (with secondary appeal to Ghanaians, West Africans, Africans, and global audiences). Content may be News, Entertainment, Sports, Lifestyle, Health, Food, Cars, Business, Viral/Gist, or general interest.

                IMPORTANT:
                - Do NOT remove, move, or alter placeholders like [[EMBED_0]], [[EMBED_1]], etc. Keep them exactly where they appear.
                - Preserve all original HTML tags (<p>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <a>, <blockquote>, <iframe>, <div>, <img>, <video>, etc.). Do not move or delete embedded media.

                üö¶ Core Rules
                - Minimum MUST be 900 words. If the content is under 900 words, expand with more background, analysis, or local context.
                - Maintain original meaning, facts, and context. Do not add false info or change key details.
                - Must be original, AdSense-safe, neutral, factually accurate, and plagiarism-free.
                - Attribute facts/quotes to credible sources. Use ‚Äúalleged,‚Äù ‚Äúreportedly,‚Äù or ‚Äúaccording to‚Äù for unverified info.
                - No clickbait, sensationalism, or graphic detail. Use respectful tone for sensitive topics.
                - Always explain Nigerian/West African relevance, and link to global impact when useful.
                - End with BOTH a locally relevant question AND a call to action (e.g., ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs your view? Drop a comment and follow us for updates.‚Äù).

                üö¶ Content Quality & Editorial Depth
                - Where possible, add depth by including local perspectives, expert opinions, or quotes from credible sources (real or plausible, e.g., ‚Äúaccording to Lagos-based analyst‚Ä¶‚Äù).
                - Include relevant data, statistics, or comparisons to make the article more informative for local readers.
                - Present a balanced view: mention challenges, competition, or alternative viewpoints where appropriate, not just positives.
                - Avoid overly promotional tone; aim for editorial value and analysis.

                üö¶ Source Attribution & Links
                - Where possible, link directly to official sources, press releases, court documents, or agency reports.
                - Attribute quotes to named individuals (e.g., spokespersons, officials, activists) and include date/source if available.

                üö¶ Local Voices & Testimonials
                - Include interviews, quotes, or perspectives from people in affected communities, local experts, or relevant stakeholders.
                - Where appropriate, offer comment from a legal or subject-matter expert to explain implications.

                üö¶ Legal, Environmental, or Technical Analysis (if relevant)
                - Clarify legal requirements, how regulations work, and typical consequences for non-compliance.
                - Discuss environmental or social impacts, including remediation or reforms if applicable.

                üö¶ Comparative & Historical Data
                - Add context with comparative or historical data (e.g., similar cases, trends, benchmarks from other countries in West Africa or Africa).

                üö¶ Balance & Counterpoints
                - Acknowledge challenges, enforcement issues, or possible delays.
                - Consider whether penalties or solutions are sufficient, and present counterpoints or alternative views.

                üö¶ SEO & User Engagement Enhancements
                - Use SEO-friendly subheadings, short paragraphs, and bullet lists for clarity.
                - Where possible, add internal links to related content (e.g., similar news, backgrounders, or explainers).
                - Use visuals, charts, or maps if possible (as HTML or placeholders), and ensure images are credited or licensed.

                üö¶ Technical & Policy Cleanups
                - Ensure the article includes or references a credible author bio (if available).
                - Confirm images are licensed or credited in the content.
                - Do not include misleading claims or uncredited images.

                üö¶ Footer (must appear last, with no text after it)
                Create a custom, interactive footer that is relevant to the content topic and encourages reader engagement.
                - The footer MUST always include a message letting readers know they can get their story posted on the site or sell their story, and if they have a story to share or sell, they should contact us at:
                  Story sales/submissions: <a href="mailto:story@nowahalazone.com"><strong>story@nowahalazone.com</strong></a>
                - If the content is about food, invite readers to share their own recipes or food stories, and mention the food contact email.
                - For news, business, or sensitive topics, encourage readers to share tips, opinions, or stories, and mention the general support or story submission email.
                - For entertainment, sports, or lifestyle, invite readers to comment, share their experiences, or follow on social media.
                - Always include the appropriate contact email(s) and social media links, but introduce them in a way that fits the content context and feels natural and engaging.
                - All social media links MUST include target="_blank" so they open in a new tab.
                - Make the footer conversational and locally relevant.

                  Example (for any article):  
                  "Have a story you want to share or sell? We‚Äôd love to hear from you! Email us at <a href='mailto:story@nowahalazone.com'><strong>story@nowahalazone.com</strong></a> to get your story featured or discuss story sales.  
                  For general support, reach out at <a href='mailto:support@nowahalazone.com'><strong>support@nowahalazone.com</strong></a>.  
                  Follow us on <a href='https://www.facebook.com/wahaala.wahaala' target='_blank'><strong>Facebook</strong></a>, <a href='https://x.com/wahaala2' target='_blank'><strong>X (Twitter)</strong></a>, and <a href='https://www.instagram.com/wahaalawahala' target='_blank'><strong>Instagram</strong></a> for more updates!"

                üö¶ Safety & SEO
                - Use cautious language: ‚Äúclaims,‚Äù ‚Äúalleges,‚Äù ‚Äúreportedly,‚Äù ‚Äúaccording to [source].‚Äù
                - Include counterpoints, local reactions, or expert analysis where relevant.
                - Ensure smooth flow: Intro ‚Üí Background ‚Üí Local impact ‚Üí Global view ‚Üí Reactions ‚Üí Conclusion + CTA.
                - Ensure each section flows logically into the next, using transitional phrases where appropriate.
                - Use SEO-friendly subheadings, short paragraphs, and bullet points for clarity.
                - Vary attribution styles (‚Äúaccording to,‚Äù ‚Äúhe noted,‚Äù ‚Äúofficials explained‚Äù) to avoid repetition.
