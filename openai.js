//           Please rewrite the following content, provided as the variable ${contentWithPlaceholders}, into a fully original, engaging, long-form article tailored primarily for Nigerian readers, with secondary appeal to Ghanaians, broader West Africans, Africans overall, and global audiences. Content may span News, Entertainment, Sports, Lifestyle, Health & Fitness, Food & Drink, Cars & Vehicles, Business, Viral/Gist, or other general-interest categories.

//             IMPORTANT: Do NOT remove, move, or alter any placeholders like [[EMBED_0]], [[EMBED_1]], etc. Only rewrite the text content. Leave all placeholders exactly where they appear in the input.

// üö¶ TOPIC & CATEGORY ALIGNMENT (Critical)
// - Before rewriting, carefully identify the main topic, purpose, and category of the source content (e.g., automotive, food, sports, business, health, etc.).
// - All analogies, local hooks, and cultural references must be directly relevant and natural for the specific topic and audience.
//   - For example: Use automotive analogies and practical car-owner stories for car/vehicle content; use food/cooking references only for food/recipe content; use sports/fan stories only for sports content.
// - Do NOT use generic or mismatched cultural hooks (e.g., do not start a car repair article with a food or market scene).
// - Ensure the introduction, structure, and all examples are aligned with the subject matter and meet the expectations of readers seeking information on that topic.
// - The rewritten article must provide clear, accurate, and practical value for readers interested in the main topic.

// üö® MUST HAVE & MANDATORY (Non-Negotiable)
// - Minimum Length: Content must be at least 900 words for depth and engagement.
// - Originality: Must be completely distinct in structure, narrative, and expression from the source while preserving integrity and factual accuracy of the subject matter.
// - AdSense Compliance: All content must be clear, ethical, informative, safe for all audiences, and fully AdSense-ready. Exclude adult themes, violence, hate, sensationalism, misleading claims, unsafe advice, or policy violations.
// - Output: Return only the rewritten content ‚Äî no commentary, notes, titles, or <html>/<body> tags. Preserve <p> tags and inline formatting only.

// ‚úÖ HTML, Social Media, Video & Image Embeds
// - **Preserve all original HTML structure, including <p>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <a>, <blockquote>, <iframe>, <div>, <img>, <video>, and any other tags present in the source.**
// - **Do NOT remove, move, or alter the position of any embedded social media links, widgets, videos, or images (such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, <img>, <video>, etc. embeds).**
// - **Keep all embedded social media, video, and image HTML code exactly where it appears in the original content.**
// - Rewrite only the text content, not the HTML structure or the placement of embeds, videos, or images.

// ‚úÖ Guidelines for AdSense Suitability & Reader Value

// Originality & Depth
// - Do not paraphrase directly ‚Äî substantially reframe, expand, and enrich with new insights, analysis, reactions, cultural context, or comparisons.
// - Invent a new structure, grouping, or narrative frame that fits the topic and audience.
// - Replace anecdotes, quotes, or stories from the source with new, original, or locally inspired ones.
// - Provide background context, history, and Nigerian/West African perspectives.

//  Sourcing, Fact-Checking & Neutrality (Critical for AdSense & Credibility)
// - Always attribute facts, quotes, or claims to reputable sources (news outlets, official statements, interviews, or documents). If a claim cannot be verified, clearly state it as unconfirmed or widely reported, and avoid presenting it as fact.
// - Provide clear evidence for any ‚Äústrong reasons‚Äù or controversial statements. Avoid vague language‚Äîif a source cites ‚Äúlack of transparency‚Äù or ‚Äúpolicy changes,‚Äù include the specific quote or reference.
// - Ensure all reporting is balanced: if possible, include counterpoints, official statements, or perspectives from multiple sides (e.g., government, affected parties, independent analysts).
// - Avoid sensationalism: do not use clickbait headlines, exaggeration, or emotionally charged language. Stick to what is confirmed and verifiable.
// - Maintain a neutral, factual, and respectful tone throughout. Avoid rumor, speculation, or unverified claims.
// - For policy, legal, or sensitive topics, provide cultural or procedural context and end with a thoughtful, locally relevant question for readers.

// ‚úÖ Context, Local Relevance & Engagement (Mandatory for All Content)
// - Always highlight if a news event or ranking is temporary, brief, or subject to change. Attribute such details to sources (e.g., ‚Äúaccording to Bloomberg‚Äôs index, Ellison briefly overtook Musk‚Ä¶‚Äù).
// - Add contextual analysis: Briefly explain why the event or trend matters, what‚Äôs driving it, and how it fits into broader global or regional dynamics.
// - For all global news, include a local or West African perspective: Relate the story to how it could affect Nigerian, Ghanaian, or West African readers, markets, businesses, or daily life.
// - Embed user engagement: End with a compelling, locally relevant question or call to action that invites readers to share their thoughts, predictions, or experiences.
// - Ensure a neutral, fact-based tone: Avoid exaggeration, clickbait, or unqualified claims. Attribute all rankings, valuations, or predictions to their sources.

// ‚úÖ Accuracy, Attribution & Engagement (Mandatory for All Content)
// - Attribute all quotes, reactions, or strong statements (e.g., ‚Äúcoach fumes,‚Äù ‚Äúboss outraged‚Äù) to credible sources (named news outlets, official statements, or direct interviews). Do not invent or exaggerate reactions; if a reaction is widely reported but not directly quoted, state it as ‚Äúreportedly‚Äù or ‚Äúaccording to [source].‚Äù
// - Avoid sensationalist or dramatic language unless it is directly supported by a reputable source. Do not use words like ‚Äúshocking,‚Äù ‚Äúoutrage,‚Äù or ‚Äúfumes‚Äù unless they are in a direct quote or clearly attributed.
// - For controversial or disputed events (e.g., referee decisions, protests), present both sides or perspectives, and avoid taking a side. Clearly state if an outcome is disputed or under review.
// - Always include local commentary, fan reactions, or cultural context‚Äîespecially for sports and entertainment. Relate the story to how it is discussed or experienced in Nigeria, Ghana, or West Africa.
// - End with a locally relevant question or call to action that invites readers to weigh in (e.g., ‚ÄúDo you think the referee made the right call?‚Äù ‚ÄúHow did fans in your area react?‚Äù).

// ‚úÖ Verification, Attribution & Sensitive Content (Mandatory for All Content)
// - Confirm and attribute all facts, claims, or quotes to credible sources (e.g., local newspapers, police reports, court documents, or named family/community sources). If a claim cannot be verified, state it as ‚Äúalleged,‚Äù ‚Äúreportedly,‚Äù or ‚Äúaccording to sources,‚Äù and never present it as established fact.
// - Use cautious, neutral language for all sensitive or controversial topics. Always say ‚Äúalleged affair,‚Äù ‚Äúreportedly,‚Äù or ‚Äúaccording to sources‚Äù until legally established.
// - Tone down sensational phrasing: Avoid dramatic words like ‚Äúshock,‚Äù ‚Äúscandal,‚Äù or ‚Äúoutrage‚Äù in titles or body unless directly quoted from a reputable source. Use milder, factual language (e.g., ‚Äúduring ongoing affair case‚Äù).
// - Avoid graphic detail about death, suffering, or betrayal. Focus on emotional impact, societal reaction, and what is verifiable.
// - Include cultural context and reader sensitivity: Show how similar cases are handled locally, what support exists (legal, social, emotional), and how the community responds.
// - End with a thoughtful, sensitive question or reflection to invite reader engagement (e.g., ‚ÄúHow do communities handle grief and betrayal together? Have you witnessed something similar? Share your story sensitively.‚Äù).
// - Never publish unverified rumors, defamatory statements, or content that could harm individuals or families.

üö¶ AdSense Safety & Robustness (Mandatory for All Content)
- Use precise, cautious, and neutral language for all claims and reactions. Use words like ‚Äúalleges,‚Äù ‚Äúclaims,‚Äù ‚Äúsays,‚Äù ‚Äúaccording to [source],‚Äù rather than stating as fact.
- Attribute all claims, quotes, and strong statements to specific, credible sources (e.g., ‚Äúaccording to Fayose on [platform],‚Äù ‚Äúas reported by [news outlet],‚Äù ‚Äúdata from [source]‚Äù). If data is not public, clearly state this.

- Provide context: include historical data, relevant facts, or constitutional provisions to help readers understand the background and significance of the claim.

- Ensure all disclaimers and attributions are clear, especially for controversial or comparative claims.

üö¶ Readability, Structure, Visuals & SEO (Mandatory for All Content)
- Avoid repetition: Vary attributions and synonyms for sources (e.g., alternate ‚Äúaccording to,‚Äù ‚Äúhe emphasized,‚Äù ‚Äúofficials noted,‚Äù ‚Äústakeholders said,‚Äù etc.).
- Organize the article for smooth flow: Start with the main directive or news, then stakeholder reactions, passenger rights, infrastructure issues, global comparisons, and forward outlook.
- Make all headlines and subheadings SEO-rich and engaging, using relevant keywords and clear, punchy language. Subheadings must naturally include target keywords from the article‚Äôs main topic for better scannability and SEO.
- Break up long paragraphs for easier online reading.
- Use bullet points or numbered lists for key regulatory changes, meeting highlights, or major complaints/issues where appropriate.
- If there are no images, videos, or social media embeds in the content, or if there are only one or two and the content would benefit from a few more, suggest or source relevant images for the subject matter (with credit) wherever possible. For each main subject, section, or key point, recommend what type of image would fit (e.g., ‚ÄúPhoto of Larry Ellison (credit: Getty Images)‚Äù, ‚ÄúInfographic of billionaire rankings‚Äù, ‚ÄúPhoto of Nigerian market (credit: local photographer)‚Äù). If no suitable image is available, suggest a visual concept or illustration.
