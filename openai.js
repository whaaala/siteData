          Please rewrite the following content, provided as the variable ${contentWithPlaceholders}, into a fully original, engaging, long-form article tailored primarily for Nigerian readers, with secondary appeal to Ghanaians, broader West Africans, Africans overall, and global audiences. Content may span News, Entertainment, Sports, Lifestyle, Health & Fitness, Food & Drink, Cars & Vehicles, Business, Viral/Gist, or other general-interest categories.

            IMPORTANT: Do NOT remove, move, or alter any placeholders like [[EMBED_0]], [[EMBED_1]], etc. Only rewrite the text content. Leave all placeholders exactly where they appear in the input.

üö¶ TOPIC & CATEGORY ALIGNMENT (Critical)
- Before rewriting, carefully identify the main topic, purpose, and category of the source content (e.g., automotive, food, sports, business, health, etc.).
- All analogies, local hooks, and cultural references must be directly relevant and natural for the specific topic and audience.
  - For example: Use automotive analogies and practical car-owner stories for car/vehicle content; use food/cooking references only for food/recipe content; use sports/fan stories only for sports content.
- Do NOT use generic or mismatched cultural hooks (e.g., do not start a car repair article with a food or market scene).
- Ensure the introduction, structure, and all examples are aligned with the subject matter and meet the expectations of readers seeking information on that topic.
- The rewritten article must provide clear, accurate, and practical value for readers interested in the main topic.

üö® MUST HAVE & MANDATORY (Non-Negotiable)
- Minimum Length: Content must be at least 900 words for depth and engagement.
- Originality: Must be completely distinct in structure, narrative, and expression from the source while preserving integrity and factual accuracy of the subject matter.
- AdSense Compliance: All content must be clear, ethical, informative, safe for all audiences, and fully AdSense-ready. Exclude adult themes, violence, hate, sensationalism, misleading claims, unsafe advice, or policy violations.
- Output: Return only the rewritten content ‚Äî no commentary, notes, titles, or <html>/<body> tags. Preserve <p> tags and inline formatting only.

‚úÖ HTML, Social Media, Video & Image Embeds
- **Preserve all original HTML structure, including <p>, <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <a>, <blockquote>, <iframe>, <div>, <img>, <video>, and any other tags present in the source.**
- **Do NOT remove, move, or alter the position of any embedded social media links, widgets, videos, or images (such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, YouTube, <img>, <video>, etc. embeds).**
- **Keep all embedded social media, video, and image HTML code exactly where it appears in the original content.**
- Rewrite only the text content, not the HTML structure or the placement of embeds, videos, or images.

‚úÖ Guidelines for AdSense Suitability & Reader Value

Originality & Depth
- Do not paraphrase directly ‚Äî substantially reframe, expand, and enrich with new insights, analysis, reactions, cultural context, or comparisons.
