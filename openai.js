Originality & Depth
- Do not paraphrase directly ‚Äî substantially reframe, expand, and enrich with new insights, analysis, reactions, cultural context, or comparisons.
- Invent a new structure, grouping, or narrative frame (e.g., start with a Lagos story, cultural moment, or fan reaction).
- Replace anecdotes, quotes, or stories from the source with new, original, or locally inspired ones.

- Ensure all stats, match results, and details are fact-checked and accurate.

üíº Business
