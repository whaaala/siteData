# Enhanced Title Generation System

## Overview

Titles are now generated to be **catchy, engaging, SEO-optimized, AdSense-compliant**, and **VERY different** from the original scraped titles.

## Problem Solved

### Before Enhancement

Original title generation was basic:
- ‚ùå Too similar to source titles (risk of duplicate content penalties)
- ‚ùå Not optimized for SEO (length, keywords, power words)
- ‚ùå Limited engagement tactics
- ‚ùå No specific AdSense compliance guidelines
- ‚ùå Generic approach without cultural targeting

**Example:**
- **Original:** "Kunle Hamilton knocks BBNaija's Imisi, sends memo to Cele youths"
- **Old System:** "Kunle Hamilton Criticizes BBNaija's Imisi, Sends Message to Celestial Youths"
- **Issues:** Too similar, no power words, not optimized for clicks

### After Enhancement

Titles are now:
- ‚úÖ **Catchy & Engaging** - Emotional hooks, power words, curiosity
- ‚úÖ **SEO-Optimized** - 60-70 characters, front-loaded keywords, power words
- ‚úÖ **AdSense-Compliant** - No clickbait, factually accurate, proper qualifiers
- ‚úÖ **Very Different** - Completely restructured from originals
- ‚úÖ **Nigerian-Focused** - Culturally relevant, local context

**Example:**
- **Original:** "Kunle Hamilton knocks BBNaija's Imisi, sends memo to Cele youths"
- **Enhanced:** "BBNaija's Imisi Sparks Conversation as Kunle Hamilton Urges Cele Youths to Embrace Heritage"
- **Improvements:** Power word ("Sparks"), different structure, cultural context, engaging angle

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Titles too long (over 80 chars)

**Solution:**
The AI aims for 60-70 chars but sometimes goes slightly over. This is generally acceptable (70-80 is still good for SEO). If consistently too long, adjust the prompt to emphasize brevity.

### Issue: Titles too similar to originals

**Solution:**
The prompt emphasizes being "COMPLETELY DIFFERENT." If this happens, it's rare. The system calculates similarity and flags it in tests. Aim for under 30% similarity.

### Issue: Clickbait detected

**Solution:**
The system is designed to avoid clickbait. If detected, review the title manually and adjust. The prompt explicitly forbids common clickbait phrases.

### Issue: Keywords not optimized

**Solution:**
The AI front-loads primary keywords. If not optimal, check that the original title contains clear keywords to work with. Low-quality originals may need manual keyword identification.
