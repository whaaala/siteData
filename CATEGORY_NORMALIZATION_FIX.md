# Category Normalization Fix - Critical Bug Fixed

## Problem Discovered

During WordPress category mapping validation, discovered that `normalizeCategory()` was **breaking 3 categories**:

❌ **Before Fix:**
```javascript
normalizeCategory('Gists') → '' (empty string)
normalizeCategory('HealthAndFitness') → '' (empty string)
normalizeCategory('FoodAndDrink') → '' (empty string)
```

This meant posts from **premiumtimesng.com**, **naijanews.com**, **gistreel.com**, and **yabaleftonline.ng** would have **NO CATEGORY** assigned!

## Root Cause

The `normalizeCategory()` function was designed to handle **raw lowercase category strings** from scraped websites (like "gist", "health", "recipes").

However, our new URL-based inference code passes **TitleCase already-normalized categories** (like "Gists", "HealthAndFitness", "FoodAndDrink").

```javascript
// In scrapeRaw.js we do:
category = 'Gists'  // TitleCase

// Then we call:
category = normalizeCategory(category)  // Expected TitleCase, got empty string!
```

## Solution Implemented

Modified `normalizeCategory.js` to detect and preserve already-normalized categories:

```javascript
export function normalizeCategory(rawCategory) {
  if (!rawCategory) return '';

  // NEW: If category is already normalized (exact match), return it as-is
  const exactMatch = rawCategory.trim();
  const validCategories = ['News', 'Entertainment', 'Sports', 'Lifestyle', 'Gists', 'HealthAndFitness', 'FoodAndDrink', 'Cars'];
  if (validCategories.includes(exactMatch)) {
    return exactMatch;  // Preserve TitleCase
  }

  // Continue with existing lowercase normalization logic...
  const cat = rawCategory.trim().toLowerCase();
  // ...
}
```

Also added lowercase variants for robustness:
- `cat === 'gists'` (line 116)
- `cat === 'healthandfitness'` (line 144)
- `cat === 'foodanddrink'` (line 153)

## Fix Location

**File:** `normalizeCategory.js`
**Lines:** 9-13 (exact match check), 116, 144, 153 (lowercase variants)

## Test Results

**Before Fix:**
```
❌ Gists → empty string → No WordPress mapping
❌ HealthAndFitness → empty string → No WordPress mapping
❌ FoodAndDrink → empty string → No WordPress mapping
```

**After Fix:**
```
✅ Gists → WordPress ID 1
✅ HealthAndFitness → WordPress ID 27
✅ FoodAndDrink → WordPress ID 24
```

**Comprehensive Test:** `testCategoryMapping.js`
```
✅ 7/7 categories fully mapped
✅ All categories have WordPress IDs
✅ All categories have author pools
✅ ALL SITES USE VALID MAPPED CATEGORIES
```

## Impact

### Sites Affected (Would Have Had Empty Categories):
1. **premiumtimesng.com** - HealthAndFitness, FoodAndDrink posts
2. **naijanews.com** - Gists posts
3. **gistreel.com** - Gists posts
4. **yabaleftonline.ng** - Gists posts
5. **punchng.com** - Gists posts

### WordPress Mapping Verified:

| Category | WordPress ID | Author Pool Size |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| News | 35 | 11 authors |
| Entertainment | 21 | 10 authors |
| Sports | 45 | 11 authors |
| Lifestyle | 30 | 10 authors |
| Gists | 1 | 11 authors |
| HealthAndFitness | 27 | 11 authors |
| FoodAndDrink | 24 | 11 authors |

## Verification

Run this test to verify all mappings:

```bash
node testCategoryMapping.js
```

Expected output:
```
✅ SUCCESS: All inferred categories are properly mapped to WordPress!
✅ All categories have WordPress IDs
✅ All categories have author pools
✅ ALL SITES USE VALID MAPPED CATEGORIES
```

## Prevention

The exact-match check at the beginning of `normalizeCategory()` now prevents this issue from happening again if we add more URL-based inference in the future.

Any TitleCase category from the valid list will be preserved as-is instead of being processed through the lowercase normalization logic.

**Status:** ✅ FIXED AND TESTED
**Severity:** Critical (would have caused empty categories)
**Test Coverage:** 7 categories × 3 checks = 21 assertions, all passing
